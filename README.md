# Simple Shell Project README

## Description

This is a simple shell project that provides a basic command-line interface for interacting with your computer's operating system. A shell is a fundamental part of any Unix-like operating system, allowing users to execute commands and manage files and processes.

## Features

- Command execution: You can run various system commands and programs using this shell.
- Command history: Easily access and rerun previous commands using the command history feature.
- Custom commands: Extend the shell's functionality by adding your own custom commands.
- Basic file operations: Perform basic file and directory operations such as creating, deleting, and moving files.
- Pipeline support: Execute multiple commands in sequence using pipes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can use this simple shell, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [C compiler (gcc)](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-shell.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd simple-shell
   ```

3. Compile the shell using the provided Makefile:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. Run the shell:

   ```bash
   ./simple-shell
   ```

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can use it like any other command-line interface. Here are some basic commands and examples:

- Running a system command:

  ```bash
  $ ls
  ```

- Running a custom command (if implemented):

  ```bash
  $ mycommand arg1 arg2
  ```

- Redirecting output to a file:

  ```bash
  $ ls > file.txt
  ```

- Running commands in the background:

  ```bash
  $ long-running-command &
  ```

- Using pipes to connect commands:

  ```bash
  $ command1 | command2
  ```

- Accessing command history:

  ```bash
  $ history
  ```

For more information on available commands and options, refer to the shell's built-in help or consult the project's documentation.
